Description: Code refactoring to make the Horiseon application more accessible to users. 

User Story: As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines. 

Acceptance Criteria: 
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Tasks: 
The application's links all function correctly.
The application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
The application's CSS file is properly commented.
